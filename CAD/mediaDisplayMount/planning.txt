96mm of internal vertical clearance
RPi heat sink has 9.1mm of clearance (might need more, adjust Vertical extension feature of midHolder to change)
--> could also change Screwhole links sketch to provide more room above RPi CPU (should easily get an extra 5mm)

Audio layer:
Clearance relative to side holes: 33mm to front cutoff (allows room for display holder) and 82mm to backplane position (literally to rear edge of metal casing)
Side hole spacing: 174mm
Consider vertical clearance to logic assy as 8mm down from side hole height
Consider amp PCBs as 15mm tall (85x62 screwhole pattern)
Vertical distance between bottom screwholes and side holes is 48-3.5=44.5mm (dist from bottom to side holes - height of bottom screwhole standoff)
Shortest horizontal distance from frontmost screwhole to side hole is 75mm (76mm - (2mm-1mm))
Distance from same screwhole to side of RPiAndDriverHolder is 68.5mm therefore dist from that side to sidehole is 75-68.5=6.5mm (but 7.5mm looks better)

To figure out:
Bluetooth media audio (VIM4 I think)

Car shopping list:
USB soundcard or equivalent with surround capabilities --> check linux driver compatibility
--------------> Use two HS-100B based 2.1ch USB cards (need to add USB hub to top level because of this)
Extensions for SMA and RP-SMA of cellular rounter (not really needed, nvm)
Extensions for USB3/ETH in head unit
Extensions for mic/line out for sub
HDMI extension for center console and dashboard displays

RPi 4 handles:
GUI for media display and center console
CANBUS interaction for simple toggles?
Navigation

VIM4 handles:
Camera recording
Camera streaming
Media playback
Alert sounds
Audio mixing (surround)
Computer vision
CANBUS streaming
Dashboard display
Diagnostics
