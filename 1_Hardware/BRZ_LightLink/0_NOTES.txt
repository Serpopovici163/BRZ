Schematic notes:

MOSFET_V2 includes redundant MOSFETs with summed DIAG output (5V assuming V_BATT = 12V)
--> One MOSFET outputs 4V and the other 1V (12V/Rx where x is the resistor corresponding to MOSFET in question)
--> Circuitry based on summing op-amp from Wikipedia

MOSFETs_V2 includes an array of MOSFET_V2 sheets with op amps to generate an analog output based on DIAG output
--> output of op-amp component is 3.3V assuming V_BATT = 12V to accomodate for higher than normal voltages
